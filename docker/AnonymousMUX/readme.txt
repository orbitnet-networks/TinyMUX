INSTRUCTIONS:

 - Build the base Tinymux Docker image first.
 - Place the unique files for your game in the game sub-directory. On easy way to do this is to untar a recent backup.
 - Name your flatfile to be data/netmux.db so that it will be loaded automatically the first time the game runs.
 - Run "docker build -t AnonymousMUX ."
