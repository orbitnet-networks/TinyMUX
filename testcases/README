This project holds the TinyMUX test cases.  The code is formatted and must be
unformatted and quoted into a game.

After building netmux from ./mux/src, the smoke test database, smoke.flat, is
built with:

    ./tools/Makesmoke

This above script depends on Sed, Perl, Telnet, and Expect.  It also starts
and stops a server instance on port 2860.  The test cases are unformated with
unformat.pl, a Perl script.  The resulting quotable installer is uploaded into
a running server running on port 2860 using upload.tcl, a Expect script.
Finally, the resulting database is unloaded and scrubbed with scrubflat.sed,
a Sed script.

The resulting smoke.flat database automatically runs all the tests and then
shuts itself down.  No clients connections are needed to initiate or manage
this.

After building the server from ./mux/src, the smoke test data, smoke.flat, is
used with:

    ./tools/Smoke

The results of the test will be in smoke.log.
