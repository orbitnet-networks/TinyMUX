tinymux (2.10.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * New maintainer. (Closes: #830140)
  * As suggested by lintian, update Standards-Version in debian/control from
    3.9.6 to 3.9.8.
  * Removed first paragraph from tinymux-install.1 man page because the
    tinymux-install program is not part of the upstream package.
  * Freshened the first paragraph of tinymux.6 man page to give the reader a
    better sense of what can be built.
  * Removed the reference to Amberyl's MUSH Manual because the link points to
    what is now a completely different website.
  * As suggested by lintian, added debian/watch file and signing-key.asc.
  * As required, convert debian/copyright to deb5 format.
  * Migrate debian/rules to shortened version, add debian/install and
    debian/clean, and remove debian/dirs. This simplifies things
    considerably.
  * Enabled hardening in debian/rules to address build warnings about
    hardening control via CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
