 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 make reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
     - "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
       Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
       created through textual modification.
     - "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
       modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
       the Copyright Holder.
     - "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
       copyrights for the package.
     - "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
       this Package.
     - "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
       of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
       so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
       Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
       that must bear the fee.)
     - "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
       itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
       also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
       the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
 the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
 that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
 associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
 provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
 stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
 at least ONE of the following:
 .
   a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
   them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
   Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
   major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
   Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
   Package.
 .
   b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
   organization.
 .
   c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
   with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
   a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that
   clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
   a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
   files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
   equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
   b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
   the Package with your modifications.
 .
   c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
   Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
   non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in
   manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where
   to get the Standard Version.
 .
   d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
 this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
 software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
 as a product of your own.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.
 .
 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
 shall not be considered part of this Package.
 .
 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 written permission.
 .
 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
